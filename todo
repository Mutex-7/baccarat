The plan:
Server boots up.
Starts new game immediately.
Send new game page to client.
Client starts with new game.

Client has a button to load most recent save.
  Send load message to server.
  Server parses file on disk. Validation, etc. Spec!
  Sends game data to client. Will have to send entire history as well.
  Client parses. Spec?
  Client updates it's atoms.

Client has button to save game to edn.
  Notify server to save the game.
  Server saves a copy of the game state to disk.
  Server notifies client that game was saved (un?)successfully.

Then to deal with this shitty UI.

TODO:
CSS:
  -have the textboxes beside the label, not under.
  -get all historical display components to be in a second column on the screen.
SVG:
  -???
remotes:
  -handle a save command
  -handle a load command
components/place-bet:
  -Is this a bit long or repetetive? Refactor with a macro or something?

Bugs:
