Load and save using most recent save file, not just one save-slot.
  -use this for saves: (spit (str (java.util.Date.)) @session)
Entire right side display. Text-based at first, just to get it working.
  -Player is blue, dealer is red, ties are green.
  -Plates move top to bottom, left to right.
  -Use colored numbers, instead of a grid?
  -bead plate: display winning hands.
  -big road:
    -move to next column when the other player wins.
    -green slash through the circle when next hand is a tie, or a natural win.
    -determine max hight needed here, based on chance it'll happen.
  -big eye boy:
    -on big road column change, if depths were the same, record a red circle. else a blue.
    -if the current hand is the same result (skipping ties) as the previous one, compare BR left and BR left-up. if same, red, else blue.
    -basically check BR left and BR left-up. same? red. not same? blue.
  -other things:
    -why TF is this so complicated? for a game where you ultimately lose in the long run... smh.
Then go graphical? Not really sure how.
CSS:
  -have the textboxes beside the label, not under.
  -get all historical display components to be in a second column on the screen.

Bugs:
Spamming insurance bets = surefire money making scheme. Not right at all. What's up with that?
stats/money and stats/update-money are a bit slow. Can sense lag if you spam bets.
